django-receipts "project" branch
================================

The Real Python article `Writing an Installable Django App <???>`_ that this code is associated with explains how to take an existing Django project and make a installable package out of one of its apps. 

This branch contains the "before" condition, a sample Django project with the 
receipts app as part of the project. The `master branch <https://github.com/realpython/django-receipts/tree/master>`_ contains the "after" condition, where receipts has been moved out of the project.
